# This repository is to store my playground for data structures and algorithms

## Why?
I don't come from a computer science background. I am not the smartest programmer, and I definitely can't sit there and think of a crazy efficient algorithm to solve a problem. The best way for me is to understand the problem, have examples of expected results, break down the problem, and solve the problem incrementally. This is a place for me to revisit to shape and hone my problem solving skills via code.
